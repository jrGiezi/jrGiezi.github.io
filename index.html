            <h2> About </h2> <!-- starting an about me section -->

            <p> I graduated university with a degree in Music Industry Management, however, upon leaving school I
                quickly came to realize I was more interested in photography, writing, and the outdoors than I was in
                managing a band or artist. </p>

            <p> While floundering about for a new career path, I fell in love with coffee shops. I figured this might be
                the way to go, seeing as how I'd wanted to own and operate my own third-wave coffee establishment back
                home in downtown Detroit. Alas, barista life does not pay the bills (unless you truly wish to have
                multiple roommates well into your 30s).</p>

            <p> During this time, I came to realize several things. I realized that, while I had an eye for photography,
                I desired more stability in knowing where my monthly incoming was...well, coming from. Remaining a
                barista would be a hindrance to actually opening my own shop in the future as well, given the need for a
                financial kick start. </p>

            <p> After much deliberation, I came to two paths: carpentry or coding. And while I love the instant
                gratification of physically making something from a material like wood, the path of coding, though
                daunting, was too enticing and intriguing to pass up. So here I am, trying each day to figure out what
                it's all about. </p>
